Supavec MCP Server is a new way to fetch relevant content from Supavec in LLMs.

## What is MCP?


[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) is a protocol Anthropic came up with that connects AI to stuff like your Google Drive and websites.

Think of it as a universal plug — just like how USB lets you connect different gadgets without needing special cables for everything.

## The problems MCP solves

The big problem it fixes? AI has been pretty isolated from real data. What good is a smart assistant if it can't even access your calendar?

MCP creates a standard way for information to flow between systems, so AI can actually give useful answers.

It's still a work in progress though — definitely not perfect yet. But I think it's pretty promising for making AI actually useful in day-to-day life. 

## Fetch relevant content to your question from Supavec with LLMs

Let's look at a simple example of how to use Supavec MCP servers on Claude Desktop app.

### 1. Download the MCP server

First, you need to download the MCP server from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/taishikato/supavec-mcp-server).

### 2. Build the MCP server

```bash
npm i && npm run build
```

### 3. Get your Supavec API key

Sign up at [Supavec](https://www.supavec.com) and get your API key.

### 4. Add the MCP Server to Claude for Desktop

Add the following to your `~/Library/Application\Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supavec": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/supavec-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
          "SUPAVEC_API_KEY": "<your api key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Let's try it out!

Open the Claude Desktop app and ask it to fetch relevant content from Supavec. Here I'm trying to figure out where I was flying to from my boarding pass stored on Supavec.

One thing you should know is that you need to pass the `file_id` to the prompt.
