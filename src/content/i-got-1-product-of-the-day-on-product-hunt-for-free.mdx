On Sunday, April 14, at 2:01 PM in Thailand, my product - [AutoRepurpose](https://www.autorepurpose.io/) was launched on Product Hunt.

Like my previous launches, I wasn't expecting anything crazy. I figured Iâ€™d probably end up around 8th place or something.

But an hour later, when I checked AutoRepurpose's ranking on [Hunted.space](https://hunted.space/), to my surprise, we were in 2nd place! However, this kind of early success can be deceptive, as other products often catch up at an insane pace, and I usually end up back around 8th.

But this time was different.
Four hours in, AutoRepurpose hit an unexpected first place!
And it stayed there even after 20 hours after the launch!

As a result, I achieved my first-ever #1 product of the day.

This accomplishment on Product Hunt, where many startups compete, felt like a major achievement for me as a solopreneur.

## Wait, what is AutoRepurpose?

Let me give you a quick introduction to AutoRepurpose.

AutoRepurpose turns YouTube videos into text content for Twitter thread, LinkedIn posts and etc for YouTube creators to grow their social media 10x faster.

So basically it's a YouTube repurpose tool.

## So how did I build AutoRepurpose?

As a solopreneur with very limited budget and time, it's crucial to choose a tech stack that is:
- Affordable
- Quick to set up
- Reliable

For AutoRepurpose, I opted for [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as the backbone of the backend. It has reliably supported [Penelope AI](https://penelopeai.com/), which garnered over 15k users in 2022 without any issues.

I use Supabase for its:
- Database (also as a Vector database)
- Realtime capabilities
- Auth features
- Storage solutions

Using Supabase allows for easy setup of these components, making it ideal for quickly building and launching products.

I find the Vector database and Realtime capabilities particularly invaluable.

This is because, in many cases, you'd need to use a separate service like Pinecone for a vector database, and implementing Realtime features often takes a lot of time. Using Supabase helps avoid these complexities and streamlines the development process.

I was able to launch AutoRepurpose just three weeks after starting to build it.

## How much traction did I get from the launch?

I tweeted about it here.

  />
</a>

At its peak, AutoRepurpose received about 1.3k visits in one day. We had around over 100 sign-ups.

Does that sound lower than expected?

Sundays on Product Hunt tend to be relatively quiet, so that might be part of it.

However, I'm happy I was able to handle this volume of traffic for free.

I'm still using Supabase free plan haha.

## What I used other than Supabase?

Apart from Supabase, I use [Modal](https://modal.com/). I consider it the best hosting service for running ML and AI processes in Python.

Modal gives you free $30 credits every month, so it's free unless your app scales enough (and it's a good thing!)

## I'll stick with them

When I build software products, I consistently use Supabase, Modal if needed, and Next.js (you should use whichever framework you're most comfortable with).

Especially with Supabase, which just went GA (General Availability) during the latest launch week, they're rolling out more new features, making it even more essential to keep an eye on.
