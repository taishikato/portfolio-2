## What is Supabase!?

On the website, it says **The Open Source Firebase Alternative**

[The Open Source Alternative to Firebase. | The Open Source Firebase Alternative | Supabase](https://supabase.io/)

It has Authentication, Database, storage(coming soon), and function(coming soon) just like Firebase does.

I converted my Firebase project into Supabase one and I am gonna write down my impression of it ‚úçÔ∏è

## Authentication

The authentication feature of Supabase is as easy and handy as Firebase.

We can sign up with the third parties too.

* Google
* Github
* Gitlab
* Azure
* Facebook
* Bitbucket

I tried with GitHub and the procedure of setting is the same as Firebase.

We have to create a GitHub app and put `App Client Id`, `secret` and call back URL.

  height={400} 
/>

Supabase takes care of the call back URL ‚úåÔ∏è

```
https://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

If you want users to sign up/sign in with a GitHub account, you can simply put the code below.

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

const handleSignUp = async () => {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    // provider can be 'github', 'google', 'gitlab', or 'bitbucket'
    provider: 'github',
  })
}
```

Firebase's Authentication feature is very easy to use and so convenient.
What I am impressed with is that Supabase's Authentication feature has the same level as Firebase's.

This is really amazing.

## Database

I bet many of you have wished that Firebase has a relational database, not No SQL.

And Supabase comes with PostgreSQL!!
I think this is the biggest difference between Firebase and Supabase.

You can execute complex queries.

Firebase has Database but that's a NO SQL (Firestore) which is not good at fetching data with complex queries.

I have been waiting for the product that is like Firebase with RDB, thus Supabase is my ideal üòª

If you want to save a user's data on a database every time a user signs up, you can create a function and trigger it!

1. Create the `public.user` table

```sql
create table users (
  id uuid references auth.users not null primary key,
  email text
);
```

2. Create the function

```sql
create or replace function public.handle_new_user() 
returns trigger as $$
begin
  insert into public.users (id, email)
  values (new.id, new.email);
  return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql security definer;
```

3. Trigger the function

```sql
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
```

Reference: [Supabase GitHub Issue #563](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/563#issuecomment-772954907)

As a result, `auth.users`(that Supabase automatically creates and not accessible for the public)  and `publis.users` (that you created with the SQL!) have the user information.

### Rules for DB

Firestore has a rule functionality.

I use it to restrict database manipulation.

```
allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
```

With Supabase, we can do the same thing with [Policies](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth#policies).
You can create politics from a dashboard or with SQL.

```sql
create policy "Individuals can update their own data." on users for
    update using (auth.uid() = id);
```

Now my `users` table has one policy.

Make sure the `users` table is locked (Row Level Security is on).

/>

### Wanna use a complicated query?

Of curse, you can.

Because of security risk, you can't use some type of query with [Supabase's npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@supabase/supabase-js).
But just same as normal PostgreSQL, you can create a view and use it from the front-end.

**Create a view**

```sql
CREATE VIEW public.events_by_month AS
SELECT to_char(generate_series(event_months.min, event_months.max, '1 month'), 'Mon-YY') AS months
FROM (
  SELECT
    date_trunc('month', min(start_date)) AS min,
    date_trunc('month', max(start_date)) AS max
  FROM events
) event_months
```

**Use the view**

```typescript
const response = await supabase
    .from('events_by_month')
    .select('*')
```

I used the view feature to execute the query with the join clause and it worked ü§©

## Summary

When compared to Firebase, Supabase offers the same ease of use as Firebase. This is great.
In addition to that, you can use Relational Database.

In my case, I wanted to create a Tinder-like app and it's easy to imagine that the RDB feature is essential for data fetching. And I just went for Supabase üöÄ

It's not hard for Supabase to become a must-have for my app development.

If you are a developer who uses Firebase a lot, and you need a relational database, Supabase will surely help you!
